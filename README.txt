(b) When a user presses the key <c> or <C>, the program will print out
"Quadratic equation will be calculated, the results are: "
and the results will be given. The real as well as the complex solution should be oered (see Note).
(c) When a user presses the button <w> or <W>, the program will print out
"The program is waiting".
Within the wait state the program has to execute a loop that terminates after a counter reaches a
predetermined limit. This limit has to be set by the user. Please check the plausibility of the input
(only non-negative limit is allowed) and print an error message if necessary.
(d) When a user presses the button <t> or <T>, the program will print out
"The program will be terminated".
